## Unity Application Configuration ##
Unity is a powerful and flexible real-time development platform utilized to create interactive experiences on multiple platforms. With its user-friendly interface and component-based approach, developers can build games, simulations, and interactive applications with ease. Unity supports various programming languages, most notably C#, enabling efficient scripting. Its strengths lie in cross-platform compatibility, real-time rendering, physics and simulation capabilities, and a vast asset store for readily available resources. Collaboration is seamless, and Unity's functionality can be extended through custom scripts and plugins. It is highly regarded for empowering developers to efficiently create visually impressive and immersive experiences, contributing to its widespread popularity.
Developing an application for the HoloLens using the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) in Unity, utilizes a specialized set of tools and components designed to facilitate the creation of mixed reality experiences. 

### Setting up the Development Environment ###

**Install Unity:** Install the appropriate version 2020.3.46f1 of Unity (64-bit) that supports MRTK and HoloLens development.
**Import MRTK:** Add the MRTK package to your Unity project, which can be obtained from the Unity Asset Store or the MRTK GitHub repository.
**Set up HoloLens Emulator:** Configure and utilize the HoloLens Emulator to simulate the HoloLens device on your development machine.



### Project Configuration: ###
**Configure Unity:** Adjust the project settings in Unity, including platform settings for Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) and the HoloLens.
**Import MRTK Profiles:** Import and configure MRTK Profiles, which provide pre-defined settings for input, interactions, and spatial mapping.

### Scene Setup: ###
**Designing the User Interface:** Create and position holographic UI (User Interface) elements using MRTK's input and interaction systems, such as buttons, sliders, or hand gestures.
**Spatial Mapping:** Utilize MRTK's spatial mapping system to enable understanding and interaction with real-world surfaces and objects.
**Input Handling:** Implement input handling using MRTK's input system to respond to gestures, voice commands, or gaze interactions.
